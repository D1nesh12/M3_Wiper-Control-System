Over the past two decades, the automotive industry has aggressively researched ways to exploit modern computing and electronic advances in the development of safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies for vehicles. With drivers exposed to an ever-increasing number of distractions,rain-sensing wiper systems become an even more appealing feature, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take his/her hands off the wheel. Most traditional systems offer intermittent as well as variable speed operation. The traditional wiper system however requires the driver's constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed. Traditional windshield wiper speed constantly varies according to time and vehicleâ€™s speed. The manual adjustment of the wiper distracts the driver's attention, which may be a direct cause of accidents automatically according to the amount of water on the windshield and in addition with also in advance removal of moisture inside the car while raining. The majority of motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, locomotives, watercraft with enclosed cabins, and some aircraft, are fitted with one or more such wipers, which are usually legal requirements. Wiper systems improve the visibility of driving and can be considered an integral part of the vehicle safety system.
