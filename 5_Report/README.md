## M3_WiperSystem

## Introduction
Wiper system is automatically ON during the time of rainfall. The senor is fixed in the vehicle glass. The conductive (Touch) sensor is used in this project. It senses the rainfall and giving control signal to the control unit. The control unit activates the wiper motor automatically.

## SWOT Analysis

## Strength
It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains. This saves money by cutting off bills on electricity consumption.It consumes less power for operation.

## Weakness
The cost of overall system increases as additional components are needed along with rain sensor.In order to avoid false detection of rain, it requires rain sensors to take decision after few minutes.
